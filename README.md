## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18+ and **pnpm**
- Check Bagisto [backend requirment detail](https://bagisto.com/en/download/)

---

## Installation

1) Install Bagisto
 
    Begin by [installing the Bagisto](https://devdocs.bagisto.com/) eCommerce platform on your server or local environment.

2) Install the Bagisto Headless Extension

    After installing Bagisto, install the [Bagisto Headless Extension](https://github.com/bagisto/headless-ecommerce/) to expose the required APIs for your frontend.

3) Configure `.env.local` in the Next.js Project

   In your Next.js frontend project, create or update your `.env.local` file with the following variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SITE_NAME` | Your store name | `My Awesome Store` |
| `BAGISTO_STORE_DOMAIN` | Your Bagisto backend URL | `https://api.mystore.com` |
| `IMAGE_DOMAIN` | Domain for product images | `api.mystore.com` |
| `REVALIDATION_DURATION` | ISR cache duration (seconds) | `3600` |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Your frontend URL | `https://mystore.com` |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Random secret for NextAuth | Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` |


**Important Notes**  
- You will need to use the environment variables defined in `.env.example` to run Next.js Commerce.  
- It’s recommended to use **Vercel Environment Variables**, but a `.env` file is sufficient for local development.  
- **Never commit your `.env` file** to version control — it contains secrets that would allow others to control your Bagisto store.

**Vercel Setup**

Install the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

Link your local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (this creates the `.vercel` directory):

```bash
vercel link
```

Download your environment variables:

```bash
vercel env pull
```
4) Update next.config.js with Required Runtime Config

   This project customizes the Next.js configuration to optimize performance, images, and caching.
```env
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  allowedDevOrigins: ["local-origin.dev", "*.local-origin.dev"],
  images: {
    unoptimized: false,
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: "https",
        hostname: process.env.IMAGE_DOMAIN,
      },
    ],
  },
  env: {
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
    NEXTAUTH_URL: process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL,
    BAGISTO_STORE_DOMAIN: process.env.BAGISTO_STORE_DOMAIN,
    REVALIDATION_DURATION: process.env.REVALIDATION_DURATION,
    SITE_NAME: process.env.SITE_NAME,
  },
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/",
        headers: [
          {
            key: "Cache-Control",
            value: "public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=8640",
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;

```
